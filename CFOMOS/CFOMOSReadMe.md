# FOMOSv1-Yellow


FOMOSv1-Yellow is an opensource GUI replacement for Linux made with C GTK.

FOMOS stand for: Free, Opensource, Mobile, Operating, System

One day FOMSO will become it's own operating system but for now it'll just be a GUI replacement.
#
# About
FOMOS is made with C GTK which is a C library used for make GUIs. Since FOMOS is opensource you can make it do whatever 
you want with it or make it easier to use. You can contribute to FOMOS by making forks and pull requests on Github.

#
# Setup

To start FOMOS run
```shell script
sh startCFOMOS.sh
```

This will run a C file that compiles all FOMOS files and then runs FOMOSUI.c.

For now these are the only instructions for C FOMOS.

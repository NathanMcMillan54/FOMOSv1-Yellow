# About

FOMOSv1-Yellow is a desktop replacement for Linux made with ElectronJs which is a Rust library used for making GUIs with 
JavaScript. This is just a desktop UI, [FOMOSv2-CL](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/FOMOSv2-CL/) is operating system
with just a command line, hopefully in the future FOMOSv1-Yellow will be the GUI for something like FOMOSv2.
